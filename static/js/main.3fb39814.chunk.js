This runs around the map stunning things, but not actually doing much damage and being very hard to kill."},{"name":"Dawnbringer Cleric","manaCost":"{1}{W}","colors":["W"],"cmc":2,"rarity":"common","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/c/0/c00856f7-fef5-4ba5-9079-59a81d452c82.jpg?1625456245","type":"Creature \u2014 Human Cleric","rating":3,"gihWR":"53.4%","gihWRCount":680,"lsvRating":3,"lsvDescription":"Dawnbringer Cleric brings a lot to the table, and even if each ability isn\'t a game-breaker, having access to all three is quite strong. I also love the flavor, as each ability perfectly mirrors the D&D equivalent, giving this a perfect score there. The only thing that doesn\'t line up is how our D&D party points Dispel Magic at literally everything they can\'t figure out, but I don\'t think that particular habit needed representing."},{"name":"Blink Dog","manaCost":"{2}{W}","colors":["W"],"cmc":3,"rarity":"uncommon","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/c/c/cc040492-7fb7-4fdb-aafe-8179e5f2b28c.jpg?1625678424","type":"Creature \u2014 Dog","rating":1.5,"gihWR":"0","gihWRCount":0,"lsvRating":1.5,"lsvDescription":"If you have enough ways to buff the Blink Dog, it can do some good work, but by itself, its bark is worse than its bite.

That\'s a solid combination, even if the ultimate is mediocre, making Zariel a threat in any game where you aren\'t losing to flyers.

That\'s a good card, and one I\'ll happily take.

It\'ll get you a little value and then trade off, which is a great place to be. Flavor-wise, Xorns love eating gems, so it would actually have worked if Rust Monster was named Xorn instead, since this concept doesn\'t fit with how most encounters with Xorns go (them demanding your Treasure)."},{"name":"Bar the Gate","manaCost":"{2}{U}","colors":["U"],"cmc":3,"rarity":"common","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/b/9/b9b1e53f-1384-4860-9944-e68922afc65c.jpg?1625102390","type":"Instant","rating":2,"gihWR":"57.0%","gihWRCount":298,"lsvRating":2,"lsvDescription":"Counterspells aren\'t usually great, but the bar gets a little lower once they have some value tacked on.
