It also does a great job of showcasing a good Paladin ability, making me think that Paladins translate better than most classes to Magic."},{"name":"Half-Elf Monk","manaCost":"{3}{W}","colors":["W"],"cmc":4,"rarity":"common","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/f/1/f10f1687-fb20-4ad2-bad7-52e4470b35e4.jpg?1625103091","type":"Creature — Human Elf Monk","rating":3,"gihWR":"50.7%","gihWRCount":9395,"lsvRating":"3.0","lsvDescription":"The Monk looks like the kind of card that overperforms – it can block well, attack and use its ability and lock down their biggest threat. I also really like the flavor, as Monks being annoying really translates well. This runs around the map stunning things, but not actually doing much damage and being very hard to kill."},{"name":"Dawnbringer Cleric","manaCost":"{1}{W}","colors":["W"],"cmc":2,"rarity":"common","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/c/0/c00856f7-fef5-4ba5-9079-59a81d452c82.jpg?1625456245","type":"Creature — Human Cleric","rating":3,"gihWR":"54.4%","gihWRCount":12490,"lsvRating":"3.0","lsvDescription":"Dawnbringer Cleric brings a lot to the table, and even if each ability isn't a game-breaker, having access to all three is quite strong. I also love the flavor, as each ability perfectly mirrors the D&D equivalent, giving this a perfect score there. The only thing that doesn't line up is how our D&D party points Dispel Magic at literally everything they can't figure out, but I don't think that particular habit needed representing."},{"name":"Blink Dog","manaCost":"{2}{W}","colors":["W"],"cmc":3,"rarity":"uncommon","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/c/c/cc040492-7fb7-4fdb-aafe-8179e5f2b28c.jpg?1625678424","type":"Creature — Dog","rating":1.5,"gihWR":"52.9%","gihWRCount":2182,"lsvRating":"1.5","lsvDescription":"If you have enough ways to buff the Blink Dog, it can do some good work, but by itself, its bark is worse than its bite. Phasing for four mana isn't a great ability either, even if it does have awesome flavor."},{"name":"Earth-Cult Elemental","manaCost":"{4}{R}{R}","colors":["R"],"cmc":6,"rarity":"common","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/f/a/fa05f317-b2f8-4eea-951b-0c374774764b.jpg?1625107219","type":"Creature — Elemental","rating":1.5,"gihWR":"55.6%","gihWRCount":7406,"lsvRating":"1.5","lsvDescription":"This is another expensive die roll card, which makes me not very excited to play it. If you need more ways to trigger your stuff, this plays, but the output of both players saccing or them doing so is not that powerful."},{"name":"The Book of Exalted Deeds","manaCost":"{W}{W}{W}","colors":["W"],"cmc":3,"rarity":"mythic","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/a/1/a1899bb1-dd8e-4437-8ea3-4ad637eabf2b.jpg?1626285954","type":"Legendary Artifact","rating":1,"gihWR":"56.5%","gihWRCount":359,"lsvRating":"1.0","lsvDescription":"If you don't have life gain in your deck, The Book is basically a blank. However, it becomes disgusting once you can reliably trigger it, and you can eventually cash it out if you have to. The flavor works for me too, as it feels epic, summons Angels and rewards good deeds (of sorts)."},{"name":"Sepulcher Ghoul","manaCost":"{1}{B}","colors":["B"],"cmc":2,"rarity":"common","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/5/b/5b302bc8-683f-4a26-ab86-87eaa19dce4d.jpg?1625252082","type":"Creature — Zombie","rating":2.5,"gihWR":"58.2%","gihWRCount":25935,"lsvRating":"2.5","lsvDescription":"Sepulcher Ghoul is reasonably-sized and lets you trigger morbid or death triggers at will.

That's a solid combination, even if the ultimate is mediocre, making Zariel a threat in any game where you aren't losing to flyers. The flavor is great too, as she's a commander in the war of Devils against Demons, while also being known for a rash and aggressive nature."},{"name":"Minion of the Mighty","manaCost":"{R}","colors":["R"],"cmc":1,"rarity":"rare","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/f/f/ffd0a827-778b-48c3-bb85-4b4acef351d6.jpg?1625679665","type":"Creature — Kobold","rating":0,"gihWR":"0","gihWRCount":0,"lsvRating":"0.0","lsvDescription":"The flavor is sweet here, and I especially like that the Minion probably dies when it summons a Dragon. For this to work in Limited, you'd need to have this, a Dragon, six power of creatures and not be able to just cast the Dragon. That's not a parley I'm interested in betting on."},{"name":"Hill Giant Herdgorger","manaCost":"{4}{G}{G}","colors":["G"],"cmc":6,"rarity":"common","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/b/6/b69315cc-c230-4704-9d66-411f624f3e49.jpg?1625171287","type":"Creature — Giant","rating":3,"gihWR":"56.1%","gihWRCount":17839,"lsvRating":"3.0","lsvDescription":"Just look at that delicious mutton flavor – I bet this guy enjoys a good MLT. It's also a great finisher for ramp decks, as three life goes a long way in stabilizing the board and reducing risk."},{"name":"Werewolf Pack Leader","manaCost":"{G}{G}","colors":["G"],"cmc":2,"rarity":"rare","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/e/8/e88e6b39-bb4d-4d69-8007-d42f31bcbc29.jpg?1624997178","type":"Creature — Human Werewolf","rating":3.5,"gihWR":"60.3%","gihWRCount":2686,"lsvRating":"3.5","lsvDescription":"Werewolf Pack Leader is an absolute beating if you cast it early, and still does some work later in the game. That's the recipe for a premium two-drop, even if it falls a bit short of being a bomb."},{"name":"Hall of Storm Giants","manaCost":"","colors":[],"cmc":0,"rarity":"rare","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/b/f/bf8f052d-8840-4905-a807-9a305f4fd8f7.jpg?1625457433","type":"Land","rating":3.5,"gihWR":"57.0%","gihWRCount":1652,"lsvRating":"3.5","lsvDescription":"Lands that animate are always good, and all of these are strong additions to your deck. The white and blue ones are probably the best, and the black one is the worst, but realistically you should be taking and playing these all around third through fifth pick."},{"name":"Zombie Ogre","manaCost":"{3}{B}{B}","colors":["B"],"cmc":5,"rarity":"common","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/d/4/d4dbed36-190c-4748-b282-409a2fb5d134.jpg?1625603253","type":"Creature — Zombie Ogre","rating":2,"gihWR":"54.6%","gihWRCount":11805,"lsvRating":"2.0","lsvDescription":"I'm not sure what the flavor is here, though the card does good work in venture decks. It's especially brutal when paired with removal like Precipitous Drop, and I've gone on Dungeon speedruns thanks to this. Morbid decks can use it well also, and overall this has decent stats and a good ability, even if it is a bit clunky."},{"name":"Wight","manaCost":"{1}{B}","colors":["B"],"cmc":2,"rarity":"rare","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/f/6/f62abe9c-7599-433b-a964-10d6641f3586.jpg?1625004770","type":"Creature — Zombie Soldier","rating":3.5,"gihWR":"60.4%","gihWRCount":2811,"lsvRating":"3.5","lsvDescription":"Wight is a 3/2 for two that gets a lot of value if it ever gets into combat with another creature. Note that this ability works well on blocks too, making this a great card for any black deck."},{"name":"Minimus Containment","manaCost":"{2}{W}","colors":["W"],"cmc":3,"rarity":"common","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/0/5/0556f0d9-50d2-4c67-8522-de366d96500a.jpg?1625172898","type":"Enchantment — Aura","rating":3.5,"gihWR":"53.2%","gihWRCount":18252,"lsvRating":"3.5","lsvDescription":"Minimus Containment is very close to Oblivion Ring, and even though it gives them a Treasure, if they use that Treasure, they're giving up on ever getting their thing back. That's a good card, and one I'll happily take. The flavor is on point too, as one of the modes of the Imprisonment spell does exactly this"},{"name":"Demogorgon's Clutches","manaCost":"{2}{B}","colors":["B"],"cmc":3,"rarity":"uncommon","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/5/8/581e7ac6-65e5-4a16-ab0b-0988c3a3cfea.jpg?1625410388","type":"Sorcery","rating":1.5,"gihWR":"52.9%","gihWRCount":1449,"lsvRating":"1.5","lsvDescription":"I've so far not liked main-decking Mind Rot, so this isn't a high priority. The extra mill and life loss helps, making this a little more appealing in attacking decks."},{"name":"Nadaar, Selfless Paladin","manaCost":"{2}{W}","colors":["W"],"cmc":3,"rarity":"rare","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/8/7/878a0d8c-11c1-4c65-9051-78e036ac496f.jpg?1624530978","type":"Legendary Creature — Dragon Knight","rating":4,"gihWR":"66.3%","gihWRCount":2889,"lsvRating":"4.0","lsvDescription":"Nadaar is one of the stronger venture cards, both making it easier to complete a Dungeon and rewarding you for doing so. This also feels quite paladin-like, making it a flavor win on top of being a strong build-around."},{"name":"Owlbear","manaCost":"{3}{G}{G}","colors":["G"],"cmc":5,"rarity":"common","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/3/0/30e8a00f-8131-470d-8072-4c23b812281a.jpg?1625679724","type":"Creature — Bird Bear","rating":3.5,"gihWR":"57.1%","gihWRCount":23833,"lsvRating":"3.5","lsvDescription":"Owlbear plays great, as it's a huge monster that replaces itself and has very relevant stats. The flavor is a miss for me, but they can't all be winners."},{"name":"Eyes of the Beholder","manaCost":"{4}{B}{B}","colors":["B"],"cmc":6,"rarity":"common","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/3/f/3f9e5402-690f-497d-ada3-aa41fa900fdd.jpg?1625509691","type":"Instant","rating":1.5,"gihWR":"51.2%","gihWRCount":5232,"lsvRating":"1.5","lsvDescription":"Beholders have 11 eyes (10 eye stalks plus the central one), so this is a great flavor fit. It's a bit clunky, making it a card I'm not that excited to actually play, but it is removal if you need it."},{"name":"Xorn","manaCost":"{2}{R}","colors":["R"],"cmc":3,"rarity":"rare","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/f/7/f73fdf76-e3a6-49d0-bfb0-4b7cdbd4271e.jpg?1625247238","type":"Creature — Elemental","rating":3,"gihWR":"52.7%","gihWRCount":2132,"lsvRating":"3.0","lsvDescription":"Xorn is a fantastic card in the RB Treasure deck, and decent in any deck that has a few ways to make Treasure. It'll get you a little value and then trade off, which is a great place to be. Flavor-wise, Xorns love eating gems, so it would actually have worked if Rust Monster was named Xorn instead, since this concept doesn't fit with how most encounters with Xorns go (them demanding your Treasure)."},{"name":"Bar the Gate","manaCost":"{2}{U}","colors":["U"],"cmc":3,"rarity":"common","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/b/9/b9b1e53f-1384-4860-9944-e68922afc65c.jpg?1625102390","type":"Instant","rating":2,"gihWR":"53.9%","gihWRCount":4675,"lsvRating":"2.0","lsvDescription":"Counterspells aren't usually great, but the bar gets a little lower once they have some value tacked on. This can stop them from developing while progressing your dreams of being an adventurer, but gets pretty bad against wary opponents."},{"name":"Potion of Healing","manaCost":"{1}{W}","colors":["W"],"cmc":2,"rarity":"common","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/d/5/d5edb608-c7d7-4fa9-b969-262c9789fc17.jpg?1625331975","type":"Artifact","rating":1.5,"gihWR":"55.0%","gihWRCount":3372,"lsvRating":"1.5","lsvDescription":"I'd only play this if I wanted to up my artifact count or had life gain synergies, as it's not quite worth it solo. I really like the flavor, because drinking a potion in D&D is a free action, which drawing a card does a good job of emulating."},{"name":"Lair of the Hydra","manaCost":"","colors":[],"cmc":0,"rarity":"rare","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/b/6/b670bb0f-680f-4036-bdb6-ac73e866a398.jpg?1625603485","type":"Land","rating":3.5,"gihWR":"57.7%","gihWRCount":2169,"lsvRating":"3.5","lsvDescription":"Lands that animate are always good, and all of these are strong additions to your deck.

Flavor-wise, I like that it becomes a seasoned adventurer once it survives a dungeon pass and “levels up” into double strike."},{"name":"Temple of the Dragon Queen","manaCost":"","colors":[],"cmc":0,"rarity":"uncommon","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/0/c/0c79b3c6-ccbe-48ae-a1f7-ddfd37ecdbf5.jpg?1625678532","type":"Land","rating":3,"gihWR":"53.9%","gihWRCount":8785,"lsvRating":"3.0","lsvDescription":"Both these are essentially the same card, though the Temple has a lot more text. They are both five-color fixers where you choose a color and stick to it, and both are fine pickups for two-color decks (and critical for three or more color ones)."},{"name":"Trickster's Talisman","manaCost":"{U}","colors":["U"],"cmc":1,"rarity":"uncommon","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/3/3/33cb9973-c9ce-48f1-9972-651092624751.jpg?1625603103","type":"Artifact — Equipment","rating":2.5,"gihWR":"51.1%","gihWRCount":2923,"lsvRating":"2.5","lsvDescription":"This feels appropriately tricky, and gives you a decent reward for getting a creature through.  The +1/+1 helps get your 4/4 past theirs, and throwing this on a flyer isn't the worst either. I'd want a lot of creatures and some ways to get them through (pump, removal, evasion) before playing this, but most decks will be able to supply that."},{"name":"Purple Worm","manaCost":"{5}{G}{G}","colors":["G"],"cmc":7,"rarity":"uncommon","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/e/4/e419d58b-6241-4892-9080-f6894ac7ba89.jpg?1625711241","type":"Creature — Worm","rating":3.5,"gihWR":"54.2%","gihWRCount":6794,"lsvRating":"3.5","lsvDescription":"Purple Worms are gigantic and devour many a beast or adventurer, so I buy this flavor-wise, and it's a steal if you ever get it for just five mana. Even at seven, it's a solid threat, and the high-roll games where you play this on turn five are going to be huge blowouts."},{"name":"Arcane Investigator","manaCost":"{1}{U}","colors":["U"],"cmc":2,"rarity":"common","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/d/c/dc457520-9947-4f65-bbe7-9b95bd2c23af.jpg?1625246508","type":"Creature — Elf Wizard","rating":1.5,"gihWR":"52.7%","gihWRCount":8330,"lsvRating":"1.5","lsvDescription":"Two-drop dorks with powerful mana sink abilities used to be fantastic, but my appetite for these has gone down dramatically. You just don't run out of cards to play in modern Limited formats, and the scenarios where this would be good are few and far between. If you have to play this, it'll be fine, but my perception is that this isn't great."},{"name":"Sorcerer Class","manaCost":"{U}{R}","colors":["R","U"],"cmc":2,"rarity":"rare","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/f/7/f754b385-a28d-48de-a91f-2b4f33cc47f7.jpg?1625603397","type":"Enchantment — Class","rating":0,"gihWR":"0","gihWRCount":0,"lsvRating":"0.0","lsvDescription":"I don't really get this card. It pushes you to have a lot of creatures and a lot of spells, with kind of strange payoffs all around (plus a Faithless Looting to start).

If the opponent doesn't kill this the turn you play it, Xanathar's ability means they are never drawing an answer – if their top card sucks, just don't cast it. This is so good it actually seems unfun, and I don't think it's beatable if not immediately dealt with."},{"name":"Wandering Troubadour","manaCost":"{3}{G}","colors":["G"],"cmc":4,"rarity":"uncommon","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/d/3/d3c7f123-31c8-469b-85e5-d20c4d21b2a0.jpg?1625679674","type":"Creature — Dragon Bard","rating":3.5,"gihWR":"56.4%","gihWRCount":7845,"lsvRating":"3.5","lsvDescription":"Wandering Troubadour wins the game single-lutedly when left unchecked, and is a pretty good combatant when needed.

That's a bomb in my book, and it's cheap enough that you'll be able to cast it in basically every game where you don't get totally screwed. It does fit better in aggressive decks, but any deck is vastly improved by adding this.

In Limited, you’ll soon get to seven loyalty thanks to the multiple protection abilities this has, and if you can pick up even one Monk, you’ll be very happy with the Grand Master. Very few creatures can dodge the lockdown ability, and once this hits seven, you get to run rampant, making this a very high pick.

I have to say that this flavor doesn't do it for me either – it does capture the Magic version of Wish, but not the D&D version. Wish is a ninth level spell, one of the most powerful in the entire game, and a retread of previous Magic Wish cards doesn't feel right to me.

It's a pretty good one, so I'd check it out if you're a fan of lore. As for the card, the main issue here is of course the casting cost.

That makes this a solid lord/pinger combo, which is a great deal for three mana. I don't get the story of new Goblins showing up letting the Lord shoot things, but whatever."},{"name":"Ranger's Hawk","manaCost":"{W}","colors":["W"],"cmc":1,"rarity":"common","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/9/d/9d7a7744-e49d-4b4e-b6ae-7fc6d2892cef.jpg?1625130352","type":"Creature — Bird","rating":3,"gihWR":"54.3%","gihWRCount":13749,"lsvRating":"3.0","lsvDescription":"The tiny flyer slot in white used to always be terrible and now is always great, with Ranger's Hawk looking to continue that trend.

Being able to generate Treasure or sacrifice it helps with the Treasure decks, it's good in the morbid decks that want things to die and it can technically help ramp you to something big. It's not for every deck, but a couple color pairs will have decent synergy with it."},{"name":"You Find Some Prisoners","manaCost":"{1}{R}","colors":["R"],"cmc":2,"rarity":"uncommon","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/0/f/0f2a95ae-feb2-42c3-99b4-9ea7a491d326.jpg?1625106663","type":"Instant","rating":2.5,"gihWR":"49.8%","gihWRCount":2279,"lsvRating":"2.5","lsvDescription":"My adventuring parties definitely choose to interrogate most prisoners first (though they do ultimately release them, most of the time), making this flavor a solid hit. I've been happy playing it in most decks too, as it's basically a Shatter/Anticipate split card of sorts. Picking from the opponent's deck is certainly worse than yours, but it's still a good buyout if you have no artifact targets in sight."},{"name":"Unexpected Windfall","manaCost":"{2}{R}{R}","colors":["R"],"cmc":4,"rarity":"common","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/b/a/bae6a5fb-39f5-4cf8-85f7-661cb4570507.jpg?1625353320","type":"Instant","rating":1.5,"gihWR":"51.1%","gihWRCount":7033,"lsvRating":"1.5","lsvDescription":"I haven't found room for this in most decks, as Contact Other Plane is better in UR, and RW and RG aren't interested in card draw at this cost.

She fits perfectly into what RB is doing, and offers a strong enabler/payoff combo, which always is a hit. Your creature all end up pretty large if you have good ways to generate Treasure, and overall you get a ton for just two mana here.

It just takes too many things going right before this has a good impact on the board, with the main problem being that the +2/+0 is hard to get to trigger at a time that does something.

It's nice that this eats most Classes, as it can hit nonland permanents and not just creatures, but it's still not a bomb.

That means you have to just tap out for it on seven and hope you don't die, your reward getting to play your best spell (then your second best, and so on).

What really puts it over the top is that you can threaten to advance to the third level if the opponent ever lets damage through later, putting them in an awkward spot (especially if you're playing the morbid deck and want things to die).

That seems like UR and UG more than anything else, especially with the d20 component, meaning it won't be snapped up too early in the draft. It is a whammy if you roll one through nine, as Inspiration is a lot worse than Glimmer of Genius, but the average of the two is still worth four mana.

If you can rely on having two or three other artifacts a game, this is a big headache for the opponent, as it doesn't cost much to use and the artifacts become quite large.

This hits the flavor note perfectly, and the one turn delay is a huge part of that. Sadly, that same delay makes this tough to get value from in Limited. Typically, you want the opponent to overextend into your sweeper, but when your sweeper takes an extra turn, you get hit for a lot of extra damage. The best use I can see is to play this to clean up small creatures while your big ones hold the fort, but I don't think that will come up often enough to make this great."},{"name":"Mimic","manaCost":"{2}","colors":[],"cmc":2,"rarity":"common","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/9/d/9da96aab-cf84-4150-b9d0-a4b84fcf585f.jpg?1625457354","type":"Artifact — Treasure","rating":0,"gihWR":"46.0%","gihWRCount":829,"lsvRating":"0.0","lsvDescription":"I love Mimics so much – you throw one into a campaign and your players will never trust a treasure chest again.

This doesn’t feel like The Tarrasque (see, it even gets a “The”), and while this set is full of flavor win after flavor win, this isn’t one of them. It just doesn’t feel epic, and plays mostly vanilla while in play, so I’m left wanting more. Also, it costs nine mana, so probably don’t put this in your deck unless you’re incredible at ramp."},{"name":"Barrowin of Clan Undurr","manaCost":"{2}{W}{B}","colors":["B","W"],"cmc":4,"rarity":"uncommon","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/6/8/6896c311-5593-4437-b945-43ade9665e43.jpg?1625107991","type":"Legendary Creature — Dwarf Cleric","rating":3.5,"gihWR":"56.0%","gihWRCount":5119,"lsvRating":"3.5","lsvDescription":"Barrowin is a solid enabler and payoff both, which is exactly what the BW Venture deck wants.

She's great when you're venturing into high-value rooms, but that's usually the challenge to begin with, and she ends up being a bit win-more as a result.

That said, this is a decent way to generate card advantage but doesn't really protect itself (unless you're venturing into one of the rooms that does), making it weak when you're behind on board.

I've had plenty of games where this would have been good, and if you can build a deck with enough defense, you can take full advantage of the Instrument.

It's a beating of a card, and an early frontrunner for the turn three groan test, as it wipes out two creatures a large percentage of the time.

It provides a lot of stats with haste, can generate tokens and leads to some pretty sick turns.
